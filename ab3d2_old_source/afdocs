Do you realise what you've just found? Yes, it's the complete Alien Breed 3D
2 game. No, I'm not kidding, honest. There's just one catch. This is the
complete game - as source code. You can recompile it to run on your machine,
you can even use parts of the code for the basis of your own games (the code's
freeware) or to improve the existing Team17 game, the only thing you can't do
with it is release your own commercial game based on this code.

Have fun!
