Serial Communictation

Setting the baud rate
  the value placed in the SERPER register is
  (3546895/baud)-1
  
Setting the format
  bit 15 of the SERPER register allows you to set data
  transfer at either 8 or 9 bits
  0 - 8 bits
  1 - 9 bits

Sending:
  First, you must wait for any previous serial comunication
  to be completed.  This is done by checking the Transmit
  Shift Register Empty bit (bit 12) of SERDATR (set when
  it is okay to write)

  Data is sent by placing it in the SERDAT register
  The lower 8 bits hold the byte to be sent, the 9th
  bit holds a 1 (the stop bit) and the remaining bits
  must be set to zero.
