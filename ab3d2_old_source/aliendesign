	Enemies to design:
	
NB * = already used for something else so no more
	memory used.
	
Overall guidelines:
	32 colours
	3 directions to draw: front view,
	right view and back view.
	4 frames of animation on each view
	+ a single front frame with gun firing
	or spitting etc.
	4-frame dying animation.
	
	Aliens can be of any size but unless
	VERY big+important should be no more
	than 64*64 pixels. Large impressive
	ones can be 128*128 but it should be
	noted that using these in a level may
	restrict the variety of other aliens
	available for that level.
	
	No aliens should be entirely robotic-
	if they are, we will design a vector
	object version (less memory+better
	looking)
	
	Any bullets required for the alien to
	fire must also be drawn. If a seperate
	palette is necessary, draw on a seperate
	screen; don't use 64 colour screen!
	
	Any 'special moves' the alien does
	can only sensibly be drawn from front
	view + no more than 4 frames. Would
	be possible to construct longer anims
	from those four frames (eg pulsing before
	shooting).
	
	If animations are of any form other than
	1,2,3,4,1,2,3,4,1,2,3,4,1,2,3,4 etc,
	could you make a list of the order?

Red aliens:
	First Generation Breed

	Cannon fodder to force usage of ammo!
	Change palette slightly?
	NEED DYING FRAMES.	

Mutant marines
	Hybrids

	same as ordinary marines but with
	some sort of mutant growth on head etc.
	
	Fires a rifle-type weapon (no bullets
	visible) so a single frame with small
	gun flash and front illuminated. Also
	in a different pallete to the player 2
	graphics. Use existing marine graphics
	as basis for this enemy.

	ALSO NEED DYING FRAMES FOR PLAYER 2
	AND MUTANT MARINES.
	
	Sounds:
	
	gargling dying sound (avail)
	shooting sound	(avail)	*
	shuffling walk (?)
	Scream of pain (muffled)
	Gurgling sound (as he wanders around)

Flying pink balls:

	Floaters

	Palette redesign needed. Need other
	anim frames (only one in each direction
	at the moment) + dying and shooting.

Large humanoid with blade hands:
	Second Generation Cyborg Hybrid

	128*128 pixels? Probably, for detail.
	Special move: blade slash close up.
	(3 FRAMES)
	Firing: At range, points other arm and
	fires volley of automatic fire. (1 FRAME)
	Also: pushes back arms (like someone
	skydiving) and fires large burst of plasma
	bolts(1 frame) from face/chest area
	
	NB: Frames for this alien should be RUNNING
	not walking.

	Very hard to kill, this one. Also very big
	and tall. Probably used for a mid-game
	big baddie (perhaps two or three of them in
	a specially designed level)
