This is a new chunky2planar routine.

I decided to release it on internet to stop people from using 
does ugly copper-chunky screens and 2x2 pixels 16 colors screens.

Actually this source contains 2 different routines:
They are both optimised for fastram.

Version 1:

Dithered-laced, 2x2 width pixels, 256 colors.
Linear chunky buffer. 
CPU time pr frame: 6-7 ms.
Frame rate: 50 fps.

Version 2:

Dithered-laced, 2x2 width pixels, 256 colors.
Linear chunky buffer.
CPU time pr frame 5 ms.
Frame rate: 35 fps.

The last version has a lower frame rate, but it used less
CPU time. This version should only be used on a little more 
complexed rendering.


BTW: Dithered-laced means that I use a sprite mask. This causes
a ghosted look. I try to avoid that by scrolling the pixels back and
forward 50 fps using 2 copperlist. I think it looks pretty good, but
if you for any reason don't want the small lace flickering and want 
to have a ghosted look instead, its not hard to remove the second 
copperlist. :)


The routine is is based on $dff102 scroll trick used in blitterscreen1.01.


The blitterscreen assembler source WAS A BIG MESS 
(probably the worst source I have ever seen, that's my opinion anyway! ;)

So I decided to make a new routine. Which I hope is a little easyer to
understand. :)
