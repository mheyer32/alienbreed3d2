 dc.b 0,1,"Then the memory of my ordeal floods back, and I start upright with a cry,       "
 dc.b 0,1,"staring hectically around at the unfamiliar room.                               "
 dc.b 0,1,"Gradually I take in my surroundings. I seem to be in the quarantine bay of an   "
 dc.b 0,1,"Earth Force ship; a military one from the looks of things.                      "
 dc.b 0,1,"They must have found me! But was I all they found..? Feverishly I check the     "
 dc.b 0,1,"status panel on my medical bed. Green across the board; no evidence of          "
 dc.b 0,1,"contamination. I let out a sigh of relief. Time to meet my rescuers, then.      "
 dc.b 0,1,"I buzz the intercom, and wait. No reply. I try again, but to no avail.          "
 dc.b 0,1,"Where is everyone? I disengage myself from the life support apparatus, pulling  "
 dc.b 0,1,"tubes from various places, which is when I notice the smell.                    "
 dc.b 0,1,"I find the source almost immediately; a crumpled form huddled out of sight      "
 dc.b 0,1,"in the corner of the room. His pale dead hand loosely grips a shotgun, and a    "
 dc.b 0,1,"trail of dark stains leads from the door to the pool in which he slumps.        "

 dc.b 0,1,"The rest of the earth ship seems almost deserted. Examining the ship's log I    "
 dc.b 0,1,"piece together what must have happened.                                         "
 dc.b 0,1,"This ship, the battlecruiser INDOMITABLE, was dispatched to Osiris base to      "
 dc.b 0,1,"ensure nothing escaped the destruction I caused. They found me floating near    "
 dc.b 0,1,"to death in the shuttle I used; pulled me on board and stuck me in quarantine.  "
 dc.b 0,1,"They were preparing for the return hyperspace jump when something appeared      "
 dc.b 0,1,"out of nowhere, something HUGE, which shut down their main power systems,       "
 dc.b 0,1,"then docked. After that it gets confusing; the ship being attacked by alien     "
 dc.b 0,1,"soldiers, the crew fighing back, boarding the enemy vessel to try and break     "
 dc.b 0,1,"free. That's all; after that the records are empty. Seems like I'm the one that "
 dc.b 0,1,"got away. Even if I could pilot this monster on my own, which I can't, I        "
 dc.b 0,1,"couldn't leave maybe two or three hundred people captive, especially after they "
 dc.b 0,1,"saved my life.                                                                  "

 dc.b 0,1,"As I step into the shaft, some sort of energy field grabs me and lowers me      "
 dc.b 0,1,"to the bottom. As I suspected, I can't seem to make it work in reverse. No way  "
 dc.b 0,1,"to go but onwards, then.                                                        "
 dc.b 0,1,"I have no idea where the captives might be held; the alien design of this ship  "
 dc.b 0,1,"is strange and disorienting. The ship itself is constructed of a curious        "
 dc.b 0,1,"mixture of substances and designs, with bizarre crystalline surfaces next       "
 dc.b 0,1,"to hi-tech alloys next to weird organic constructions. Strangest of all, some   "
 dc.b 0,1,"of it is clearly adapted from earth technology and style, which begs the        "
 dc.b 0,1,"question: what other species have contributed to the technology aboard this     "
 dc.b 0,1,"ship?                                                                           " 
 dc.b 0,1,"I am given no time to think further about the subject, however, as the          "
 dc.b 0,1,"distant sounds of the alarm being raised snaps my attention back to the         "
 dc.b 0,1,"present. I'm going to have to keep on the move and out of sight if I am to      "
