HOW TO:

						Define Objects
						==============
						
	The term 'Object' in AB3DII has quite a broad meaning. Basically, anything which isn't a bullet,
	a player, an alien or background (walls, floors and ceilings) is an object. There are several
	main types that an object can be, and this determines its behaviour:
	
	1. Collectable
	
		The object may be collected by the player. When this happens, the player will recieve
		whatever ammunition or other supplies the object is defined to provide, and the object
		will remove itself from the map. Once so removed it will also cease to hold any doors
		and lifts.
		
	2. Activatable
	
		The object can be 'activated' by the player being within its activation radius and pressing
		the space bar. When this happens the object switches to 'active mode'. The player can
		switch it back, or it can 'timeout' and return to its inactive state. Whilst active the
		object will cease to hold any doors or lifts.
		
	3. Destructable.
	
		The object can be damaged by player bullets and explosions. Once destroyed it will cease
		to hold any doors or lifts, and will no longer impede the player.
		
	4. Decoration
	
		The object cannot be interacted with in any way and simply sits there playing through
		its animation sequence.
	
	To define an object, select OBJECTS -> DEFINE OBJECT STATS.
	
	Click on an empty space or an object you want to redefine with the LEFT mouse button, and type
	the new name. Clicking on the object with the RIGHT mouse button instead takes you into the
	actual definiton screen. On this screen are several options, some of which are only visible
	for certain types of object. They are listed here in top-bottom order:
