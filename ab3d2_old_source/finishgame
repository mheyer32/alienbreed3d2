STUFF REMAINING:

 Level Design: 6 more levels.
 	Put in Mike's level, and two more of
 	Ben's levels. This leaves THREE to be
 	designed on paper before entering.
 	REMEMBER DESIGNS:
 	Admin Block: Lots of intersecting
 	passages, very few rooms, lots of
 	stairwells and overhead bits.
 	Good place for the sentry droids,
 	marines, eyeball monsters.
 	
 	The Abyss: deep pit with lift slowly
 	going down it. Holes in the walls let
 	in aliens and have goodies in them too.
 	Could have more than one joined by
 	a narrow passage uncovered at the
 	bottom.
 	
 	NEED ONE MORE DESIGN.
 	
 Guns:
 	Put in shotgun code.
 	This requires firing several shots
 	each with a chance of hitting
 	dependant on distance (use alien code
 	for this). Include miss/hit code
 	all the time for other instant effect
 	weapons too, so accuracy is affected
 	by distance. This means shotgun simply
 	fires more bullets in one go to achieve
 	effect desired.
 
 	Flame thrower. Not much to do here.
 	Fix noise.
 	
 	Grenade launcher:
 	Make bounce noises off walls and
 	make an explosion noise occur too.
 	
 Aliens:
 
 	Put in crawly spiky thing (large).
 	Is quite big and slow, and difficult to
 	kill, and breathes fire.
 	
 	Underwater monster:
 	Fires twin energy pulses from eyes.
 	Cannot leave water.
 	
 	Red marine: fires shotgun at you
 	(multiple bullets) and does quite a
 	bit of damage. Also harder to kill.
 
Misc:
	Option screen needs doing.

Known Bugs:
	Duck and fire sometimes fails. Move up
	bullets?
