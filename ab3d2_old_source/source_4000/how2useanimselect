HOW TO:

			Use the Animation Frame Selection Screen
			========================================
			
	The Animation Frame Selection screen gives a more graphically meaningful way of selecting
	frames from your object graphic files.
	
	You will see an image (if one is defined for the graphic file you selected) in the top
	left hand corner, and some buttons below:
	
	[ PREV FRAME ]	[ NEXT FRAME ]
	
		Clicking on these cycles through the frames defined in the graphic file.
	
	[ FLIP HORIZONTALLY ]
	
		clicking on this flips the graphic. Useful for re-using side-on movement frames
		for both left and right movement.
		
	Current Frame:
	
		Shows the number of the current frame in the graphic file being displayed.
		
	DONE		Return to wherever you called the screen up from, using the frame and
			orientation you selected.
