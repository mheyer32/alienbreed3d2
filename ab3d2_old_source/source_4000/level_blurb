 dc.b 0,1,"Then the memory of my ordeal floods back, and I start upright with a cry,       "

 dc.b 0,1,"Gradually I take in my surroundings. I seem to be in the quarantine bay of an   "
 dc.b 0,1,"Earth Force ship; a military one from the looks of things.                      "
 dc.b 0,1,"They must have found me! But was I all they found..? Feverishly I check the     "
 dc.b 0,1,"status panel on my medical bed. Green across the board; no evidence of          "
 dc.b 0,1,"contamination. I let out a sigh of relief. Time to meet my rescuers, then.      "
 dc.b 0,1,"I buzz the intercom, and wait. No reply. I try again, but to no avail.          "
 dc.b 0,1,"Where is everyone? I disengage myself from the life support apparatus, pulling  "
 dc.b 0,1,"tubes from various places, which is when I notice the smell.                    "
 dc.b 0,1,"I find the source almost immediately; a crumpled form huddled out of sight      "
 dc.b 0,1,"in the corner of the room. His pale dead hand loosely grips a shotgun, and a    "
 dc.b 0,1,"trail of dark stains leads from the door to the pool in which he slumps.        "

 dc.b 0,1,"The rest of the earth ship seems almost deserted. Examining the ship's log I    "

 dc.b 0,1,"This ship, the battlecruiser INDOMITABLE, was dispatched to Osiris base to      "

 dc.b 0,1,"to death in the shuttle I used; pulled me on board and stuck me in quarantine.  "
 dc.b 0,1,"They were preparing for the return hyperspace jump when something appeared      "
 dc.b 0,1,"out of nowhere, something HUGE, which shut down their main power systems,       "
 dc.b 0,1,"then docked. After that it gets confusing; the ship being attacked by alien     "
 dc.b 0,1,"soldiers, the crew fighing back, boarding the enemy vessel to try and break     "
 dc.b 0,1,"free. That's all; after that the records are empty. Seems like I'm the one that "
 dc.b 0,1,"got away. Even if I could pilot this monster on my own, which I can't, I        "
 dc.b 0,1,"couldn't leave maybe two or three hundred people captive, especially after they "
 dc.b 0,1,"saved my life.                                                                  "

 dc.b 0,1,"As I step into the shaft, some sort of energy field grabs me and lowers me      "

 dc.b 0,1,"something wrong. The threads writhe together but seem unable to join or         "

 dc.b 0,1,"the only thing keeping me alive right now. Even as I think this, I see pulses   "
 dc.b 0,1,"of light within the silent mass. I disengage instinctively. Perhaps later I can "
