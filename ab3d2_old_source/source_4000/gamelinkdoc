	GAMELINKER PROGRAM
	==================
	
Introduction
------------

	The game linker program, as its name suggests, draws together
all the graphics and sounds you have created, and allows you to combine
them into a complete self-contained game.

The following general functions are available:

Specification of which graphic files to load (for walls, floors, objects
and so on)

Definition of individual animation frames within each graphic file

Specification of which sound effects to load during play

Complete definition of the appearance, behaviour, statistics and noises made
by up to
ten different types of alien

Complete Definition of the name, appearance, behaviour and effectiveness 
of up to twenty different types of bullets.

Definition of the name, appearance, rate of fire, firing noise and type of
ammunition used for up to ten different player guns (the extra unused bullet
types are there to allow the aliens to have different weapons from the player)

Definition of the appearance, type of behaviour (collectable, activatable
destructable or scenery) value to player (in terms of the ammo, health,
fuel, weaponry etc the player gains by activating/collecting) of up to 32
types of object.

Definition of level names and the text printed prior to playing each level

Using the Game Linker
---------------------

Upon running the program you will be presented with a simple title screen
instructing you to use the right mouse button to activate the menus in the
usual workbench fashion.

The menus available are:

	File     Edit

The File menu contains the following choices:

	Load Game Link File
	Save Game Link File

	Quit

Whilst the Edit menu contains these choices:

	Levels   ->
	Graphics ->
	Samples  ->
	Bullets  ->
	Guns     ->
	Aliens   ->
	Objects  ->

The '->' symbol indicates that further submenus can be accessed by 
highlighting that choice.

Under the 'Levels' choice you will find the following:

	Set Levels Directory
	Change Level Names

Under 'Graphics':

	Set Object GFX Frames
	Set Floor Tile Filename

Under 'Bullets':

	Define Bullet Data
	
Under 'Guns':

	Define Gun Graphic Filename
	
Under 'Aliens':

	Define Alien Stats

Under 'Objects':

	Define Object Stats
	
Each of these facilities will be documented in turn, beginning with
the 'File' menu.

LEVELS submenu
==============

	Set Levels Directory
	--------------------

	Selecting this presents you with a file requester. Navigate using this
	requester until you are *INSIDE* the directory where you want the
	LEVEL_A ... LEVEL_P directories to be created (or where they already
	have been created)
	If there are no directories with the names LEVEL_A ... LEVEL_P in the
	directory you choose, the game linker will ask you if you want to
	create them. If you do, type Y, otherwise if you wish to cancel the
	operation and choose a different directory, type N, and reselect the
	'Set Levels Directory' from the LEVELS submenu.
	
	Change Level Names
	------------------
	
	Selecting this presents you with a screen listing the names of all 16
	levels. The coloured horizontal bar above the list indicates the maximum
	width and the exact centre of the text when displayed on the game menu
	screen.
	To change a level name, just click on it with the left mouse button and
	type. Press RETURN when finished, then click on DONE if you have finished
	changing names. Remember that your names will be truncated to a length
	of 40 characters if they are too long.

GRAPHICS submenu
================

	Define Object GFX Frames
	------------------------
	
	This feature allows you to specify which graphic files are to be loaded
	into the game when it is run, and also define the position and size
	of individual animation frames within each file.

	Selecting this option brings up a screen, which if you are starting from
	scratch will have only the number '1' in the top left hand corner.
	Clicking on this number 1 with the LEFT MOUSE BUTTON will bring up a file
	requester. Use this to select either ae XXXX.DAT file generated by the 
	graphic converter, or a XXXX.WAD or XXXX.PTR file the graphic compacter
	produces. If the file is acceptable, you will see the filename you selected
	appear next to the '1', and a '2' appear just below it. You can change a 
	filename by clicking on it, or add a new one by clicking on the blank
	number at the bottom of the list.

	Clicking on an accepted name in the list with the RIGHT MOUSE BUTTON brings
	up a new screen allowing you to define the individual frames of animation 
	within that file. The screen will show the contents of the graphic file at
	the top of the screen (the bottom is marked by a shaded grey bar), and there
	are some buttons and options to select further down.

	REMEMBER:
	
	The graphic converter slices the picture file you gave it into blocks of the
	size you then specified, then joins them together to form one long horizontal
	strip. If you defined the size of the blocks to be the same as the actual
	frames of animation, the following procedure is greatly simplified.

	X: aaa Y: bbb
		These are updated continuously while the mouse pointer is over the 
		graphic strip at the top of the screen, indicating where in the
		strip you are pointing. Clicking with the LEFT mouse button whilst
		pointing at the graphic strip copies the X and Y values into the
		Frame Left and Frame Top values for the current frame.

	[SCROLL LEFT] moves the strip currently displayed 1/2 screen to the right to
	display frames lying further to the left.
	[SCROLL RIGHT] works identically but in the opposite direction.
	
	Frame Number: Indicates the number of the frame currently being defined. Each
	graphic file has a seperate set of up to 32 frames (0-31)
	
	Frame Left: Indicates the position of left hand edge of the current frame in
	the graphic strip. Clicking on the number allows you to type in a new value.
	
	Frame Top: Indicates the position of the top edge of the current frame in the
	graphic strip. Clicking on the number allows you to type in a new value.
	
	Frame Width: Indicates the width in pixels of the current frame. Clicking on
			the number allows you to type in a new value.
	Frame Height: Indicates the height in pixels of the current frame. Clicking 
			on the number allows you to type in a new value.
	
	[PREVIOUS FRAME] allows you to edit the previous frame if one exists
	[NEXT FRAME] allows you to edit the next frame unless the maximum 32
	frames have already been used.

	[COPY WIDTH TO PREVIOUS FRAMES] Copies the width of the current frame into
					all previous ones
	[COPY HEIGHT TO PREVIOUS FRAMES] Copies the height of the current frame into
					all previous ones
	[COPY WIDTH TO SUBSEQUENT FRAMES] Copies the width of the current frame into
					all subsequent ones
	[COPY HEIGHT TO SUBSEQUENT FRAMES] Copies the height of the current frame into
					all subsequent ones
					
	[GENERATE FRAMES FROM GRAPHIC DATA]
		This option uses the data provided by the graphic converter to
		automatically produce the left edges (top edges are set to 0), width
		and height of all the frames. This will only produce the desired
		effect if:
		
		All the frames are the same size
		The graphic converter was told to slice the source picture into blocks
		of precisely the size of each frame.

SAMPLES submenu
===============

	Define Sfx Filenames
	--------------------
	
	Selecting this option allows you to create a list of up to 60 sound samples
	which will be loaded along with the game. It is possible to then link specific
	actions by the player and the aliens/objects to these sounds in other sections
	of the editor.
	
	To load a sample, click with the LEFT mouse button on the space in which you
	wish to place it. A file requester will appear, with which you can select a
	RAW sound sample.
	
	NB: See IMPORTANT NOTES for information about restrictions on samples.
	
	To hear a sample as it will be played in the game, click with the RIGHT mouse
	button on a sample you have previously loaded. If no sample is in the space,
	you will be presented with the requester to select one from disk.
	
BULLETS submenu
===============

	Define Bullet Data
	------------------
	
	Selecting this option allows you to define the appearance and behaviour of the
	bullets which can be fired by the player's guns or the aliens.
	
	Initially, the screen will display a list of bullet names of the form:
	
	BULLET TYPE A			Edit bullet statistics
	  .  .  .			   .   .   .   .   .
	BULLET TYPE T			Edit bullet statistics
	
	Clicking on the bullet name allows you to type a new, more meaningful name for
	the bullet you are designing. Type the new name an press <RETURN>.
	
	Clicking on 'Edit bullet statistics' brings up a new screen with the following
	options. Please note that some of the options do not appear, depending upon the
	current settings of other options. In each case, click on the current value to
	change it.
	
	Damage To Target Per Bullet
		Defines the damage inflicted should the bullet strike a target directly.
		This does not include any damage due to explosive force.
		
	Visible Bullet or Instant Effect
		Defines whether or not the bullet is a visible (ie relatively slow moving)
		projectile, like a grenade for instance, or an 'instant' one like a rifle
		bullet.
	
	Gravity Value *NOT FOR INSTANT EFFECT*
		Indicates the effect of gravity on the bullet. Grenades are a good example
		of gravity-affected bullets, wheras energy bolts would normally have a
		value of zero.
	
	Bounce off walls *NOT FOR INSTANT EFFECT*
		A flag to decide whether the bullet rebounds from or impacts upon walls.
		
	Bounce off floors/ceilings *NOT FOR INSTANT EFFECT*
		A similar flag to the one above, this time referring to interactions with
		floors and ceilings.
	
	Bullet lifetime *NOT FOR INSTANT EFFECT*
		Defines the time in 50ths of a second for which the bullet exists, after
		which it will terminate and proceed with its impact animation and/or
		explosion. Using this value it is possible to create timed grenades or
		short range weapons like flame throwers.
	
	Explosive force *NOT FOR INSTANT EFFECT*
		A value indicating the explosive force generated upon impact/timeout of
		lifetime. The smaller the value, the weaker the explosion. Avoid excessive
		values (more than 300 or so) as it becomes very difficult to fire the weapon
		without being killed in the blast.
	
	Movement speed (0-5) *NOT FOR INSTANT EFFECT*
		Defines the speed at which the bullet leaves the gun. Each increase of 1 to
		this value represents a DOUBLING of the movement speed in the game.

	Define Bullet animation *NOT FOR INSTANT EFFECT*
		Brings up a further screen allowing you to define the appearance and
		animation of the bullet. See below for full instructions on using this
		feature.
	
	Define Impact animation
		Similar to the above option except that it defines the appearance and
		animation of the bullet after it strikes something. This animation is
		played through ONCE after which the bullet is removed from play.
	
	*** DONE ***
		Returns you to list of bullet names.

Bullet Animation definition
---------------------------

	Each 'frame' of animation for a bullet requires five pieces of information to be
	defined:
	
	Graphic File Number
		The file where the frame can be found
	
	Frame number
		The number of the frame within that file
		
	Scaled Width
		The relative width to which the frame is scaled in the game
	
	Scaled Height
		The relative height to which the frame is scaled in the game
	
	Vertical Offset
		The amount by which the visible graphic is offset vertically from the centre 
		of the actual bullet (NEGATIVE VALUES ARE UPWARDS, POSITIVE VALUES DOWNWARDS)
	
	These five pieces of information are shortened to GF, FN, SH, SW, VO in the linker,
	and you will initially see a single line of these numbers.
	
	It is possible to increase or decrease the number of frames using the * ADD FRAME *
	and * DEL FRAME * buttons at the bottom of the screen. When adding a new frame,
	notice that the five values in the previous last frame are copied to the new last
	frame. This is helpful when defining a sequence which, for example, uses the same
	graphic file for each frame, or the same scaling values or vertical offset.
	
	NB: The bullet animation will be repeated during the lifetime of the bullet, but the
	impact animation will be played only once.
	
	To change the GRAPHIC FILE value of a frame, click on the number with the LEFT mouse
	button. You will be shown a list of the graphic files you have loaded and you should
	choose one from the list with the LEFT mouse button.
	
	To change the FRAME NUMBER value of a frame, click on the number. If you do so with
	the LEFT button, you will be prompted for a number. If you do so with the RIGHT mouse
	button instead, you will be shown a picture of the current frame, with buttons to
	choose the next or previous frame in the graphic file. Clicking on *** DONE *** from
	this screen returns you to the animation screen.
	
	Click on *** DONE *** when you have finished defining the animation sequence.
	
GUNS submenu
============

	Allocate Bullet Types
	---------------------
	
	With this option it is possible to define which bullets each player gun fires, how
	many they fire, the delay between each shot being fired and which sound effect to play
	when the gun is fired. It is also possible to change the name of each gun to a more
	meaningful name.
	
	The screen changes to show a list of guns, with the name, type of bullet fired,
	number of bullets fired per shot, delay between shots (in 50ths of a second and sound
	effect played for each gun.
	
	Clicking with the LEFT mouse button on the name of the gun, the number of bullets 
	fired or the delay between shots allows you to type in a new value.
	
	Clicking on the bullet type brings up a new screen from which you can select which
	type of bullet the gun fires.
	
	Clicking on the sound effect number brings up a list of the sound effects you have
	loaded from which you can select the desired firing noise.

	Click on *** DONE *** when you have finished defining the gun data.
	
ALIENS submenu
==============

	Define Alien Stats
	------------------
	
	This is one of the most important, and most complex parts of the linker program. It
	allows you to define the complete behaviour, appearance and armament of all the 
	aliens within your game. Selecting the option brings up a screen with the aliens
	listed thus:
	
	0 ALIEN A                                      | Define Characteristics
	 . . . .                                           . . . . . . . . .
	0 ALIEN J                                      | Define Characteristics

	Clicking upon the green alien name allows you to type a new, more meaningful name
	for the alien. Clicking upon the corresponding 'Define Characteristics' button
	brings up a further screen where the characteristics of the alien can be edited.
	
	Starting at the top, the options are as follows:
	
	Graphic Type
		Clicking on this option toggles between Bitmap and Vector types. Bitmap
		graphic aliens use frames of animation from the graphic files you have
		specified. Vector graphic aliens use frames from the vector object files
		created by the Object and Animation editors supplied with this package.
	
	[ Define Animation Frames ]
		Brings up a screen listing all the different sequences of animation which
		must be defined for the alien. This option will be discussed in more detail
		later.
	
	Default Behaviour
		This describes the behaviour of the alien when active but not able to
		directly see the player.
		Clicking upon the green text describing the behaviour switches between the
		following behaviour patterns:
		
		Prowl Randomly
			The alien will wander around the map looking for the player.
		
		Prowl Randomly/Track Player.
			The alien will head towards the last position it saw the player
			standing (if known), then prowl randomly as above.
		
		Guard Start Control Pt
			The alien will head towards and wait near to the control point
			assosciated with where it was placed in the map.
			
	Reaction time
		This is the time in 50ths of a second for which the alien must see the player
		(uninterruptedly) before it will proceed into response mode (usually some
		form of attacking action).
	
	Default movement speed
		The speed at which the alien moves during its default behaviour. As a rough
		guide, a value of 16 would be a very fast alien!
		
	Response Behaviour
		This describes the behaviour of the alien when it has spotted the player (see
		 reaction time above) AND CAN STILL SEE HIM. If the player moves out of
		 sight the alien will return to its default behaviour.
		 The following options can be cycled through by clicking:
		 
		 Prowl Randomly
		 	The alien ignores the player and continues to wander.
		 	
		 Guard Start Control Pt
		 	The alien remains near to the area in which it was placed and
		 	makes no moves to attack the player.
		 
		 Attack to side (unarmed)
		 	The alien moves towards the player in an arc to keep out of the
		 	player's line of fire, trying to get in range so as to make a physical
		 	attack. SEE ANIMATION DEFINITION FOR DETAILS
		 
		 Attack with gun
		 	The alien stands and shoots its gun at the player. SEE ANIMATION
		 	DEFINITION FOR DETAILS
	
	 Response Movement Speed
	 	The speed at which the alien will move (if at all) when in response
	 	behaviour mode.
	 
	 Response Timeout
	 	The amount of time (in 50ths of a second) before the alien moves into
	 	Followup mode regardless of whether it has completed its attack or
	 	done the specified amount of damage (see below).
	 	
	 Damage Taken Limit -> Retreat
	 	The amount of damage the alien must sustain before it will enter
	 	retreat mode.
	 	
	 Damage Inflicted Limit -> Followup
	 	If the alien inflicts this amount of damage to the player in a
	 	physical attack it will move into followup mode regardless of the
	 	response timeout.
	 	
	 Followup Behaviour
		This describes the behaviour of the alien after it has ceased attacking
		but can still see the player and is not retreating. If the player goes
		out of sight during followup, the alien will go into default mode
		automatically. Clicking on the option cycles through the following:
		 
		Pause
		 	The alien pauses for a time.
		 
		Attack to side (unarmed)
		 	The alien moves towards the player in an arc to keep out of the
		 	player's line of fire, trying to get in range so as to make a physical
		 	attack. SEE ANIMATION DEFINITION FOR DETAILS
		
		Guard Start Control Pt
			The alien will return to near where it was placed in the editor.
			
	Followup Movement Speed
		The speed of the alien during followup mode (if it moves at all).
		
	Followup Timeout
		The amount of time in 50ths of a second before the alien will return
		to response mode if the player is still visible
		
	Retreat Behaviour
		This describes the behaviour of the alien after it has sustained enough
		damage in response mode. The alien will stay in this mode until a timeout
		occurs, or the player moves out of sight.
		Clicking on this option cycles through the following:
		
		Pause
	 		The alien pauses for a time.
		 
		Attack to side (unarmed)
		 	The alien moves towards the player in an arc to keep out of the
		 	player's line of fire, trying to get in range so as to make a physical
		 	attack. SEE ANIMATION DEFINITION FOR DETAILS
		
		Guard Start Control Pt
			The alien will return to near where it was placed in the editor.
	
	Retreat movement speed
		The speed of the alien during retreat mode (if it moves at all)
	
	Retreat timeout
		The amount of time in 50ths of a second before the alien will return to
		response mode.
	
	Type of bullets fired
		Clicking upon this option allows you to select a bullet type from those you
		have defined. The alien will fire these when prompted by the attacking
		animation (if it is armed with a gun; see response behaviour modes above).
	
	Number of hit points
		This is the amount of damage the alien can take before dying. If when it
		dies it sustains more than three quarters of this amount it will be deemed
		vapourised and will leave no body behind.
